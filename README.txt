Welcome to Cassiecom !!!

Thank you for using this Program
Here are some useful tips :
1. To run the app open the cassiecom.exe file.
2. The App is Portable but you should copy the whole folder for it to work in other computers.
3. You never move the files in other folders, delete or rename them.
4. You can customise the card details in the data.txt but you must always do this with caution.
   If you are not 100% sure how to do it you should NEVER try ar else the app may not work.
5. For any bugs or recomendations please feel dree to conduct me at xrist.vardakis@gmail.com
6. The controls are pretty straightforward but can be a little challenging to master.
   you can always type help while runing the program or open the help file.

Thats all!

Have fun !!
