1. READ A CARD

The only thing you need to do is give the program the card you want
 in the following format:
       hnf
Where 'h' is the house 'n' is the number and 'f' is the face of the card

acceptable values:
h : m = major arcana, c = cups, p = pentacles, w = wands, s = swords
n : number of the card, p = page, j = knight,  q = queen, k = king
f : u = upright, r = reversed

example: c1u --> Ace of Cups upright
         sjr --> Knight of Swords reversed
         m0u --> The Fool upright

2. SELECT SPREAD FORMAT

if you want to change spread format type 'select' and then select love/l for love or normal/n for normal spread or s/short for short description.
The format is set to short by default.

3. EXIT THE APPLICATION
to exit type 'exit'.
