Four of Cups Upright

In a love Tarot spread, if you are single, the Four of Cups can indicate that you may be regretting past mistakes in the love department. It can indicate that you are so focused on what is missing in your love life or the relationships you’ve had that didn’t work out, that you are missing the opportunities for love that are right in front of you. If you miss this opportunity, you may find that you deeply regret it later on so don’t dismiss potential partners or offers of dates out of hand. Sometimes we find love where we least expect it. If you are in a relationship, the Four of Cups can indicate that you have become complacent in relationship or are so caught up in a fantasy of what you want your relationship to be like that you are not appreciating it for what it is. Consider if this is a good use of your energy and what you could accomplish if you put that energy back into appreciating your partner for who they are.

Five of Cups Upright

In a love Tarot spread, if you are single, the Five of Cups can indicate that you are overcome with sadness or despair about a past relationship that did not work out. You may feel as though “The One” has slipped through your fingers and could be oblivious to potential partners as you are so focused on your sense of loss. You may also be consumed by remorse, regret or guilt. Perhaps due to mistakes you made in a past relationship. The Five of Cups is also a card of bereavement and as such, can indicate the loss of a loved one. If you have lost a partner, the Five of Cups can signify that you are isolating yourself as you feel too heartbroken to even contemplate dating anyone. If you do not feel up to dating, that is OK! However, try not to isolate yourself. You must deal with the present and try to stay grounded. Keep a supportive network of friends around you or join a support group if you need help. There is still love in your future even if you are not quite ready for it at the moment. If you are in a relationship, the Five of Cups is not a great omen as it can signify a break-up, separation or divorce. It can also indicate that you may be still harbouring old feelings about an ex rather than emotionally committing 100% to your current relationship. If so, you will need to work on resolving these feelings, if you want your current relationship to move forward. The Five of Cups can also represent abandonment or can simply indicate that fear of abandonment is causing friction in your relationship.

Nine of Cups Reversed

In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Nine of Cups reversed is not a good omen as it can indicate that the relationship is not in a good place and that one or both of you is feeling let down or disappointed with it. To the outside world, it may look like everything is fine but on the inside there may be unhappiness and lack of fulfilment. For example, you may have settled for someone who looks great on paper but you don’t truly love and are now regretting it. However, while it can point to deep seated issues, the Nine of Cups reversed can simply represent the feeling of stagnation within a relationship that sometimes comes after the initial excitement has worn off or the honeymoon period has ended. If you are single, the Nine of Cups reversed can be a sign that you are not in the right emotional/ mental state or lack the maturity to make a relationship work at the moment. If you find you have been attracting the wrong type of person, you need to work on building your self-esteem and confidence and finding your own inner contentment before you bring anyone else into the equation. Nobody else, no matter how amazing they are, can make you happy if you have not found contentment within yourself. It can also indicate emotionally unhealthy sexual behaviour or sex without love. Alternately, the Nine of Cups can indicate that you have gone to the other extreme and that your arrogance or conceitedness could be putting off potential partners.
